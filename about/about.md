Hello! I'm **Anna**, a technical writer and content creator with experience across software documentation, UX-centric writing, higher education, and editorial production. 

My background spans:

- Technical & content writing
- Designing clear instructional materials
- Managing editorial and publishing workflows
- Research in literature, humanities, and cultural studies
- Creative writing, including poetry and narrative nonfiction

I bring a blend of **technical clarity**, **research rigor**, and **creative storytelling** to every project. Whether documenting a complex workflow, editing long-form content, or shaping user-facing guidance, I focus on clarity, structure, and purpose.

When I’m not writing documentation or editing manuscripts, I'm usually **playing saxophone, composing**, or working on my **poetry manuscript**.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out!
