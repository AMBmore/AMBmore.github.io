## Hi, I'm Anna 👋

I'm a **technical writer and content designer** with experience in UX writing, documentation, editing, pedagogy, and research-heavy communication.  
I love turning complex ideas into clear, accessible material — whether that's user guides, product documentation, curriculum design, or editorial work.

On this site you'll find:

- My **technical writing projects**
- A selection of **content & editorial work**
- My **creative writing**, including poetry and essays
- Ways to **contact me** or request work samples

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to explore!
